            "none which they suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough,\n",
            "handsome enough.  It would hold the very number for comfort.\n",

            "in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.\n",

            "of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.\n",
            "Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference\n",

            "Ladies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally\n",

            "Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\n",
            "Fairfax's complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she\n",
            "would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was\n",
            "a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\n",
            "to the character of her face.\"  He listened with all due deference;\n",
            "acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he\n",
            "must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want\n",
            "of the fine glow of health.  Where features were indifferent,\n",

            "\"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\n",
            "of their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself,\n",
            "he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.\n",

            "with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--\n",

            "so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--\n",
            "so much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\n",
