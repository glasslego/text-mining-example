            "so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--\n",
            "so much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\n",
            "honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen\n",
            "from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught\n",
            "of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\n",

            "Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.  I think it would be\n",
            "much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,\n",
            "and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;\n",
            "which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home\n",

            "of course.  But you will do every thing right.  I need not tell you\n",
